# cor.py: Screen Region Coordinate Finder

This Python script helps you determine the coordinates for a specific screen region that you want to monitor or process. For example, you can use the obtained coordinates (`x, y, w, h`) to define the area where your automation script will detect a button or an image.

## How It Works

The script uses the `pyautogui` library to capture the mouse position. It will prompt you to move your mouse to two points:

1. **Top-Left Corner:** Move your mouse to the top-left corner of the target region and press Enter.
2. **Bottom-Right Corner:** Move your mouse to the bottom-right corner of the target region and press Enter.

From these two points, the script calculates:
- **x:** The x-coordinate of the top-left corner.
- **y:** The y-coordinate of the top-left corner.
- **w:** The width of the region (calculated as `x2 - x1`).
- **h:** The height of the region (calculated as `y2 - y1`).

For instance, after running the script, you might get:

```
x, y, w, h = 519, 635, 172, 105
button_region = frame[y:y+h, x:x+w]
```

This means the region starts at coordinate (519, 635) with a width of 172 pixels and a height of 105 pixels.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [pyautogui](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/)  
  Install using:
  ```bash
  pip install pyautogui
  ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python cor.py
   ```
2. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - When prompted, move your mouse to the top-left corner of the region and press Enter.
   - Then, move your mouse to the bottom-right corner and press Enter.
3. **Retrieve the Coordinates:**
   The script will calculate and display the values for `x`, `y`, `w`, and `h`. Use these coordinates in your automation or image processing scripts.

## Example Code Snippet

```python
import pyautogui

print("Move your mouse to the TOP-LEFT corner of the target region and press Enter...")
input()
x1, y1 = pyautogui.position()
print(f"Top-Left Coordinates: ({x1}, {y1})")

print("Now move your mouse to the BOTTOM-RIGHT corner and press Enter...")
input()
x2, y2 = pyautogui.position()
print(f"Bottom-Right Coordinates: ({x2}, {y2})")

# Calculate width and height
w = x2 - x1
h = y2 - y1

print(f"Calculated Coordinates: x = {x1}, y = {y1}, w = {w}, h = {h}")
```

Below is an example README file in English that explains how to update your main script with the coordinates you obtained using your coordinate finder (cor.py):

# Automated Button Color Detection and Control Script

This project uses image and color detection to determine the state of a button on your screen and control it accordingly. After obtaining the screen region coordinates using the `cor.py` script, you will update your main script with the coordinates.

## Overview

The main script performs the following steps:
- Captures a screenshot of the screen.
- Extracts a specific region (the button) based on the coordinates.
- Calculates the average color of the region.
- Compares the color with predefined "ON" and "OFF" thresholds.
- Clicks the button if it detects an "OFF" state.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `opencv-python`, `pyautogui`, `numpy`
  
Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pyautogui numpy
```

## Step 1: Obtaining the Coordinates

Use the `cor.py` script to determine the exact region of your button. This script prompts you to move your mouse to the top-left and bottom-right corners of the desired area. Once you run the script, it will print out the values for `x`, `y`, `w`, and `h`.

Example output might be:

```
x, y, w, h = 519, 635, 172, 105
```

## Step 2: Update Your Main Script

After you have obtained the coordinates, update the main script with these values. Find the section in your script where the button region is defined and replace it with the new coordinates. For example:

```python
# Coordinates of the button determined from cor.py
x, y, w, h = 519, 635, 172, 105
button_region = frame[y:y+h, x:x+w]
```

By updating these values, your script will focus on the correct screen area for detecting the button's color.

## Main Script Example

Below is a complete example of the main script with color detection and automated clicking:

```python
import cv2
import pyautogui
import time
import numpy as np

def color_distance(color1, color2):
    return np.linalg.norm(np.array(color1) - np.array(color2))

# Target colors for "ON" and "OFF" states (B, G, R)
on_target = (160, 119, 76)
off_target = (131, 128, 128)

def is_on_color(b, g, r, tolerance=30):
    dist = color_distance((b, g, r), on_target)
    return dist < tolerance

def is_off_color(b, g, r, tolerance=30):
    dist = color_distance((b, g, r), off_target)
    return dist < tolerance

while True:
    # Capture a screenshot
    ss = pyautogui.screenshot()
    frame = np.array(ss)
    # Convert from RGB (PIL) to BGR (OpenCV)
    frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)

    # Replace with your obtained coordinates:
    x, y, w, h = 519, 635, 172, 105
    button_region = frame[y:y+h, x:x+w]

    # Calculate the average color in the region
    avg_color = button_region.mean(axis=0).mean(axis=0)
    b, g, r = int(avg_color[0]), int(avg_color[1]), int(avg_color[2])
    print(f"Average color in region: B={b}, G={g}, R={r}")

    if is_off_color(b, g, r):
        pyautogui.click(x + w//2, y + h//2)
        print("Button is OFF, clicking to turn it ON")
    elif is_on_color(b, g, r):
        print("Button is already ON, no action needed")
    else:
        print("Color not recognized, adjust thresholds if needed")

    time.sleep(5)  # Check every 5 seconds (adjust as necessary)
```

## Conclusion

1. **Run `cor.py`** to determine the coordinates of the desired screen region.
2. **Update the main script** with the coordinates you obtained.
3. **Run the main script** to automate the button control based on color detection.

Feel free to adjust thresholds and timings as needed for your specific use case. Happy coding!
